# Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python (using NLTK)


History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend).

On similar lines let's create a very basic chatbot utlising the Python's NLTK library.It's a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills,but still a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone the repo to get started with the bot.


## Pre-requisites
**NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit)**

[Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing.


## Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rAJ-1312/Chatbot-in-Python-NLTK.git
cd Chatbot-in-Python-NLTK
```
2. Installing required pip packages
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script
```sh
python3 chatbot.py
```
